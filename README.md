Based on the proper management and security purposes, authorities of various institutions use different methods like verifying the identity of a person and keeping records. The system they are using to achieve this may be different. As an example, in schools, after a student is getting registered at the school, they are assigned to a class and the teacher in charge of that class will get daily attendance by marking the register. An institution that is conducting tuition will register a student for a class by filling out a form and then, their attendance will mark by a person manually using a system at the entrance of the class. In private or government offices, they may have IDs to verify them as an employee of the office and they will sign a book or will use their IDs for marking their presence. These are the most common methods which are used for.
Based on the proper management and security purposes, authorities of various institutions use different methods like verifying the identity of a person and keeping records. The system they are using to achieve this may be different. But, there are some instances where we wants to verify the identity of a user very accurately. One of the examples is examinations. Examinations are conducting in various educational institutions such as schools, universities etc.
The basic process of exams is issuing admissions for the registered candidates before the exam. At the exam, candidates can use their admissions to show have permissions to seat in the exam. Most of the times, what the invigilators do is, check admissions and IDs of candidates while conducting the exam and keeping a record.
Examinations are for the assessment of a person. Depending on various reasons, people are cheating on exams. For a year, there are considerable amount of cases that reports on violating rules in exams. One of the common violation is, seating for exams instead of someone else.

What we identified as problems here are as follows.
1. Although it is recorded as the person who attended there, cannot accurately know whether that person stays there or left.
2. The manual recording process costs time. If itâ€™s a place where many people have to enter, then there will be a queue.
3. For tuition, it needs labor costs. So, an institution with large-scale tuition has to hire people and extra costs to them. 
1. It costs time for manually check and verify users accurately.
2. Violating rules by unauthorized access of people  can be preventable.
3. Keeping records of attendances and store data can be done more efficiently.

Some systems have been introduced to give solutions for the above problems. Some websites are built up to keep records. But a person has to handle this manually. Fingerprint scanners are available now. The problem with that is if wanted, anyone can enter the place without scanning fingerprints. So unable to keep records of them. So, security is needed there to prevent someone from entering without keeping records.

So, the motivation of our project is to design a system that can verify the identity of a person/user who registered for the institution, keeping a record of their presence/attendance and confirm whether they entered after keeping the attendance record and also providing administration of relevant institution with manageable records. The system could be used for schools, tuition institutions, and offices. Students in schools, tuition, and employees in offices could use the system to enter the premises by keeping their attendance records.
So, the motivation of our project is to design a system that can verify the identity of a person/user who registered for the examination/event, keeping a record of their presence/attendance and also providing administration of relevant institution with manageable records. The system could be used for any institution where they need to have authorized people to enter/access premises.

#### Solution and the Impact

We propose to design a gatekeeping system that gets the attendance of the person using a fingerprint scanner(including a keypad and a display screen) and a drop arm gate that opens for a permitted fingerprint. The system is connected to a management system of the institution. The administration of the institution can view and handle data there.
We propose to design a gatekeeping system that gets the attendance of the person using a fingerprint scanner(including a keypad and a display screen) and a drop arm gate that opens for a correctly verified fingerprint. The system is connected to a management system of the institution. The administration of the institution can view and handle data there.
The registered users can use the fingerprint scanner. In a situation where the fingerprint scanner cannot detect the fingerprint correctly, the user can use the keypad for entering permissions. The registration number will be the key to marking attendance. After scanning the fingerprint or giving the key, the display screen will display the relevant details of the user. Then, the gate will open for some time range and the user can pass through the gate. Before and after passing the gate, the laser sensors will detect whether the user passed the gate or not. So, with this process, the administration of the institution can see the record of the entrance of the user from the website. 
So, the system will provide a solution for the above problem by reducing the time spent on the process and by reducing the labor cost if it was needed there.
So, the system will provide a solution for the above problem by reducing the time spent on the process and by accurately verifying whether a person is registered or not.
